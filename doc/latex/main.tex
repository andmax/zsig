The Zernike-\/based Vertex Signatures ({\itshape ZSIG\/}) library is a compound of C++-\/source codes to compute vertex signatures over a given meshed surface. The signatures can be used to propagate computations from one part of the mesh to many other similar regions. Each vertex signature is a set of coordinates embedding the corresponding vertex in the {\itshape feature\/} space. This space has the interesting property of grouping similar vertices, that is similarity-\/based processing is reduced to searching nearest neighbours in this space.

The ZSIG library is based on the paper: "A Robust and Rotationally Invariant Local Surface Descriptor with Applications to Non-\/local Mesh Processing" available in:

The zsig library is built...\hypertarget{main_usage}{}\section{How to use}\label{main_usage}
The zsig library is a template-\/based library built entirely on each corresponding header {\itshape \/}.hh file. Therefore to use the library just include the desired header file.\hypertarget{main_download}{}\section{How to get it}\label{main_download}
The source code of the zsig library is available under the {\itshape GNU General Public License version 3\/}, refer to the COPYING file for more details.

The zsig library can be downloaded from google code following the link:

Alternatively, a stable (but not latest) release can be downloaded from the following link:
