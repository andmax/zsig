The Zernike-based Vertex Signatures (**ZSIG**) project is a compound of C++-source codes to compute vertex signatures over a given meshed surface. The signatures can be used to propagate computations from one part of the mesh to many other similar regions. Each
vertex signature is a set of coordinates embedding the corresponding vertex in the feature space. This space has the interesting property of grouping similar vertices, that is similarity-based processing is reduced to searching nearest neighbours in this space.

The ZSIG project is based on the paper: **"A Robust and Rotationally Invariant Local Surface Descriptor with Applications to Non-local Mesh Processing"** by **Andr√© Maximo**, **Robert Patro**, **Amitabh Varshney** and **Ricardo Farias**. The paper is available at:
