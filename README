Abstract:

The Zernike-based Vertex Signatures (ZSIG) project is a compound of
C++-source codes to compute vertex signatures over a given meshed
surface. The signatures can be used to propagate computations from one
part of the mesh to many other similar regions. Each vertex signature
is a set of coordinates embedding the corresponding vertex in the
feature space. This space has the interesting property of grouping
similar vertices, that is similarity-based processing is reduced to
searching nearest neighbours in this space.

Installation:

    zsig code was written in C++ and tested on Linux platform using gcc
    4.4.3 of the Ubuntu distribution.

    The code is still in polishing process; the Zernike code is
    somewhat ok, but I still need to polish the Signatures code and
    upload it to this repository.
